## What I learned with this app

* More about TableView and SearchBar
* Use of Delegates
* Use of Structs. 
* Pagination

* Perform URLSession connection.



## The future enhancements for this app:

-  Addition of an extra screen to show information about the country clicked.
-  Addition of spinner to show the loading time.
-  Addition of the country flag image attached to the buttons of the countries listed.
-  much more!
